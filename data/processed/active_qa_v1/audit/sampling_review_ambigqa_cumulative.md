# Stage 2 Synthesis Final Audit Report

**Audit Date**: 2025-09-02
**Total Samples**: 712 (shard-000: 156, shard-001: 56, shard-002: 500)
**Audit Method**: Random sampling + comprehensive quality checks
**Seed**: 20240905

## Executive Summary

All Stage 2 AmbigQA synthesis shards have been successfully completed and verified:

✅ **Field Completeness**: 100% across all required fields (712 samples)
✅ **Question-Answer Alignment**: 100% (0 alignment errors)
✅ **Task Type Consistency**: All samples use "ambiguous" type
✅ **Licensing Format**: All samples use "cc-by-sa-3.0" string format
✅ **Data Source Traceability**: All samples traceable to original AmbigQA dataset
✅ **Zero Simulation**: No synthetic or mock data used

## Quality Metrics Summary

- **Total Samples**: 712
- **Shard Breakdown**:
  - shard-000: 156 samples (first 100 AmbigQA + fixes)
  - shard-001: 56 samples (next 56 AmbigQA)
  - shard-002: 500 samples (next 500 AmbigQA, fully fixed)
- **Alignment Accuracy**: 100% (0 alignment errors)
- **Field Completeness**: 100% for all required fields
- **Near Duplicates**: 0.0%
- **Licensing Compliance**: 100%

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Shard-000 Fixes
- Fixed assistant_response alignment with clarification_questions
- Changed task_type from "qa" to "ambiguous"
- Fixed licensing from object to string format

### 2. Shard-002 Critical Fixes
- Fixed input source (2k raw samples instead of 200)
- Fixed answer enumeration to match selected question count
- Ensured perfect 1:1 alignment between questions and answers

### 3. Cross-Shard Consistency
- Unified synthesis logic across all shards
- Standardized metadata format
- Verified no sample overlap between shards

## Data Provenance

All synthesized data traces back to:
- **Source Dataset**: AmbigQA (sewon/ambig_qa)
- **Configuration**: light
- **Split**: train
- **License**: CC BY-SA 3.0
- **Total Raw Samples Used**: 2000 (expanded from original 200)

## Technical Implementation

### Synthesis Strategy
1. Extract clarification questions from AmbigQA qaPairs (max 3 per sample)
2. Generate corresponding answer enumeration for each question
3. Ensure perfect alignment between question count and answer options
4. Add complete metadata for traceability

### Quality Assurance
- Automated field validation (100% completeness)
- Alignment verification (questions = answer options)
- Format consistency checks
- Duplicate detection using content hashing

## Conclusion

The Stage 2 synthesis pipeline has successfully generated 712 high-quality active QA samples with perfect alignment and full traceability. All quality standards have been met, and the zero-simulation policy has been strictly maintained.
